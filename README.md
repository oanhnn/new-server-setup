# New Server Setup
For automated setup, use a stack script. For manual setup, use a guide.

## Stack Scripts (recommended)

## Bash Scripts

#### Usage:
- Pull script into your server: `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rawilk/new-server-setup/master/bash-scripts/name-of-script.sh -O name-of-file.sh`
- Allow script to be executed: `chmod +x name-of-file.sh`
- Run the script: `./name-of-file.sh`

> Tip: create and run the scripts as the root user or sudo user
